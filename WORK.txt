when changing from STANDBY to CHANGE_HOUR state, sometimes when you drop the button it takes it as an pressed because of bouncing when stop pressing the button.
Maybe you can change from FALLING to RISING fbutton1 when changing from STANDBY TO CHANGE_HOUR and debounce it making no 
action when calling fbutton1 but changing again to FALLING
